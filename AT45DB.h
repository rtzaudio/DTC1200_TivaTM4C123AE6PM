 *
 *  @brief      AT45DB driver interface
 *
 *  The AT45DB header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <AT45DB.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  This example module allows an application to read from/write to a AT45DB
 *  device. The full functionality of the device has not be implemented (please
 *  refer to Enhancements below). 
 *
 *  The APIs are thread-safe. Two tasks can write/read to the same device safely.
 *  This is accomplished with a GateMutex in the implementation.
 
 *  ## Creating an instance #
 *  @code
 *  SPI_Params spiParams;
 *  SPI_Handle spiHandle;
 *  AT45DB_Params at45dbParams;
 *  AT45DB_Object obj;
 *  AT45DB_Handle at45dbHandle;
 *  volatile uint8_t ready;
 *
 *  SPI_Params_init(&spiParams);
 *  spiHandle = SPI_open(Board_SPI0, &spiParams);
 *
 *  AT45DB_Params_init(&at45dbParams);
 *  at45dbHandle = AT45DB_create(spiHandle, Board_CS, &at45dbParams);
 *  if (!handle) {
 *      System_printf("AT45DB_create failed");
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Enhancements #
 *    - Implement Security features
 *    - Utilize SRAM1 also
 *    - Continuous read features
 *    - Power features
 *    - Handle different frequencies for the reads
 *    - Get device id/manufacture information
 *    - validate with 512 page size
